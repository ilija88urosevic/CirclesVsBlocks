# CirclesVsBlocks
Made with Unity 2019.4.21f1. 
Some of the designs are moved and changed while creating the game, like moving the block to the top so itâ€™s easier to click on circles while holding the phone in hand. 
Due to limited time that was had, some parts were skipped but planned:
-	Possible change to the parsing of formula and creation of a custom one, that would be simpler and that will support what is needed for the project.
-	Better downloading of configuration, possible with some service like firebase or similar.
-	Lots of graphic can and should be upgraded but it was skipped first.
-	Formatting large numbers (e.g. 1,000,000 in 1mil).
-	Adding audio to coins, background music, attack, damage etc.
